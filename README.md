‚û°Ô∏è Final Result

This is what the project looks like, once built:

<img width="867" height="705" alt="2048 by me" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/40ba844f-2fcc-4433-839b-ccb0a748cef8" />


**Prerequisites [Install Docker & AWS CLI Login]**

1. Docker installation
2. Configure AWS CLI

**Setup Instructions** 

**1. Clone the website code**

<img width="1816" height="138" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0b4c8928-1aa1-4c34-b5ea-6170df091d6f" />


**2. Run a Docker container and push to ECR**

Check the Dockerfile to containerize the 2048 game present in the root directory. 

<img width="1030" height="544" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2b642950-a3ee-4118-8619-83c452b9864c" />


üí° This Dockerfile is designed to create a lightweight container for hosting the 2048 game using the Nginx web server. It begins by using the official `nginx:latest` image as the base, which provides a preconfigured Nginx environment.

üí°The `COPY` command transfers all the 2048 game files into Nginx‚Äôs default web root directory (`/usr/share/nginx/html`), ensuring they are ready to be served. The `EXPOSE 80` directive makes port 80 available, allowing the game to be accessed over HTTP.

üí°The `CMD` command ensures that Nginx runs in the foreground (`daemon off ') when the container starts, serving the 2048 game seamlessly.


**Build the Docker Image**

Run the following commands in the terminal to build the image (Ensure the Docker Desktop is running in the background):

<img width="1808" height="94" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aa3fbf9b-ce85-4834-8fe3-a0570de3438c" />

**Modify buildspec.yml**

Update the `buildspec.yml` by changing the placeholders:

The `buildspec.yml` file is crucial for AWS CodeBuild as it defines the build commands. You‚Äôll need to modify it to reflect your project‚Äôs ECR URI and ECS service details.

<img width="1638" height="801" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c02c6835-c095-4aa4-abd2-5b961921ca2b" />

‚Äã
**Placeholder Details:**

<your-region>: Replace this with your AWS region (e.g.`us-east-1`).

<your-ecr-repository-uri>: Replace this with your Amazon ECR repository URI (e.g., `123456789012.dkr.ecr.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/2048-game-repo`).

<image-name>: Replace this with the name of the Docker image you're building (e.g., `2048-game`).

<container-name>: Replace this with the ECS container name (e.g., `2048-container`).

**Explanation:**

- *install phase*: Specifies the Docker version to use.

- *build phase*: Builds the Docker image, logs into ECR, tags the image, and prepares it for pushing.

- *post_build phase*: Pushes the Docker image to ECR and generates the imagedefinitions.json file, which ECS uses for deployments.

- *artifacts*: The imagedefinitions.json file is saved as an artifact so it can be used in later stages like ECS deployment.

**Push Your Local Code to GitHub**

Open a terminal or command prompt in the folder where your code and `buildspec.yml` are located.
Run the following commands to push your code to the newly created GitHub repository:

<img width="1810" height="358" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ae0b9efc-c599-41d0-b72c-8337c323ce96" />


Explanation:

`git init`: Initializes a Git repository in your project folder.

`git add .`: Stages all files in the directory for commit.

`git commit -m "Initial commit"`: Commits the files to the local repository.

`git remote add origin <your-repository-url>`: Links your local repository to the GitHub remote repository.

`git push -u origin main`: Pushes the code to the `main` branch on GitHub.

**Verify on GitHub**

Visit the GitHub repository page, and you should see all your files, including the Dockerfile, buildspec.yml, and the 2048 game source code.

NEXT STEPS TO BE PERFORMED: 

1. Create an IAM Role for CodeBuild.
2. Create a S3 Bucket for Build Artifacts.
3. Create a CodeBuild Project.
4. Test the CodeBuild Project.
5. Create an AWS CodePipeline

**1. Create an IAM Role for CodeBuild**

AWS services like CodeBuild need permissions to interact with ECR (Elastic Container Registry), ECS, S3, and CodeBuild itself. To give CodeBuild all the necessary permissions‚Äî 
Create a New IAM Role

Navigate to the IAM section of the AWS console.
Choose Create Role and select CodeBuild as the trusted entity type.

<img width="1540" height="718" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f5e2c418-4cb5-4af9-994a-41997cb82cf3" />

**Attach the following Managed Policies:**

-AmazonEC2ContainerRegistryFullAccess: Allows CodeBuild to interact with ECR (Elastic Container Registry).

-AWSCodeBuildDeveloperAccess: Grants permissions for CodeBuild to access build-related resources.

-AmazonS3FullAccess: Grants access to read/write to S3 buckets (for storing build artifacts).

Attach Inline Policy for ECS:
Navigate to the codeBuildServiceRole you created and click on Add Permissions > Attach Inline Policies.

<img width="1478" height="747" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b79b0870-1f96-464a-b2d9-06508a7e61df" />

<img width="1575" height="747" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/21b33d1b-3ef0-423f-983b-ad6e4a1457b2" />

**2. Create an S3 Bucket for Build Artifacts**

CodeBuild generates output files, such as Docker images and logs. We store them in Amazon S3 so they can be accessed later. 

-Go to the S3 Console and create a new bucket (e.g., 2048-ci-cd-pipeline-artifacts1).

-Keep the rest of the settings as default and click on Create Bucket. 

**3. Create a CodeBuild Project**

The CodeBuild project is where AWS pulls your GitHub repository, builds the project (e.g., compiles code, builds Docker images), and pushes the results to S3. Create a CodeBuild project by following the steps below‚Äî 
Go to the CodeBuild Console

-Navigate to the CodeBuild Console and choose Create Build Project.

*Configure the Project*

-Project Name: Enter a project name (e.g., 2048-game-build).

-Source Provider: Choose GitHub (or other source if required) and connect to your GitHub repository. Connect to GitHub by clicking on Manage default source credential. 

-Choose the option OAuth App for Credential type and CodeBuild for service.

**5. Create an AWS CodePipeline**

AWS CodePipeline is the service that connects all the different stages of your CI/CD pipeline. First, we need to create a new pipeline to define how changes in your code will trigger builds and deployments

**Create a New Pipeline**

A pipeline is a sequence of automated steps that CodePipeline follows whenever there‚Äôs a code update. We need to define the pipeline structure before adding specific build and deploy steps.

1. Create Pipeline: Click on the Create pipeline button to begin creating a new pipeline.

2. Click on Build Custom pipeline and click Next. 

3. Pipeline Name:
Give your pipeline a name (e.g., `2048-game-pipeline`).

4. Service Role:
Create a new service role. Add a role name (`e.g. codePipelineServiceRole`). click next. 

**Add Source Stage (GitHub)**

The source stage tells CodePipeline where to pull the latest code from. In this case, we‚Äôre using GitHub as our repository.

1. Source Provider:
Choose GitHub(via OAuth App) as the source provider.

<img width="938" height="778" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/832fc0db-8b11-4ada-95f7-0bae85ba9c4b" />


3. Connect to GitHub:
Click on Connect to GitHub.
*(If you haven't already connected your GitHub account to AWS before, you‚Äôll be prompted to authorize AWS to access your GitHub repositories.)*

4. Repository:
Select the GitHub repository where your project code is stored. Ensure that this repository is the one you intend to build and deploy. Click the main branch.

5. Keep the rest as default and click Next. 

**Add Build Stage (CodeBuild)**

After pulling code from GitHub, AWS needs to build and test the application before deploying it. We use AWS CodeBuild for this step.

1. Build Provider:
Select AWS CodeBuild as the build provider.

2. Project Name:
Choose the CodeBuild project that you created earlier (e.g., `2048-game-build`).

3. Keep the rest as default and click Next.
4. Skip the Test stage.

**Add Deploy Stage (ECS Deployment)**

Once the application is built successfully, it needs to be deployed to Amazon ECS so the latest version is live. This step ensures seamless automatic updates. Deploy Provider:

Choose Amazon ECS as the deploy provider.

<img width="842" height="507" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/91164999-72f9-475b-b2fb-58801f9f6908" />


1. Cluster: Choose your ECS cluster (e.g., 2048-game-cluster).
2. Service: Choose your ECS service (e.g., 2048-service).
3. Keep the rest as default and click Next.

<img width="920" height="642" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/09aaecf4-abf0-472b-868e-b78a7ae90d68" />


**Review and Create Pipeline**

1. Review:
Review all the stages to ensure that the source, build, and deploy steps are configured correctly.

2. Create Pipeline:
Once everything looks good, click Create pipeline to finalize the process.

3. The CodePipeline will run the test process and verify that every step succeeds.
